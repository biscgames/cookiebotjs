# cookiebotjs
**config.json**: Token key allows access to your bot. I've removed my token before uploading to github because it's my bot and you're not going to touch cookiebot to raid servers or spam nsfw links which cookiebot shouldn't and will never do
<br/>**userdata.json**: The bank key is a global bank of cookies. depositing cookies allows you to takes your cookies to any server you'd like. The guildID keys hold the balance of all users' withdrawn cookies.
<br/>**index.js**: The script itself. It's very self explanatory on what it's supposed to do

Reminder that this is for NodeJS environments only!
